### _Project Name_
Trip Buddy

# The Problem
Lack of a streamlined process for creating a comprehensive travel schedule based on user preferences and specific details regarding the destination, including local attractions and cuisine options.


# Our Solution
An automated system that formulates a personalized travel itinerary by considering user-input preferences such as age range, number of days, city selection, day of visit, preferred food categories, and preferred place categories. The backend processes this information to create a day-by-day schedule on trip, of the recommended places to visit and cuisine to try. The frontend then displays this information in a tablur format, providing users with a complete and customized travel plan without the need for manual curation.

### Project Scalability/Future Plans:
We are trying to make this site faster and better using other technologies. 
In near future we are planning to implement:
1. API and Backend Scaling: Backend APIs to perform more extensive data processing, and higher requests without compromising performance.
2. Infrastructure Scalability: Implement a system that can handle increased traffic and user demands. This involves using scalable infrastructure like cloud services (AWS, Azure, etc.) to dynamically adapt to user loads.
3. Data Handling: Utilize scalable database solutions (such as NoSQL databases) that can handle growing amounts of user data and information efficiently.
4. Collaboration with Travel Services: Partner with travel services and local businesses to provide discounts, offers, or exclusive deals for users using the platform, enhancing the overall travel experience.
